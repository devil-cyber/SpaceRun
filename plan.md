## Project Creation
## Prespective point
- Prespective point will be center horizontally.
- It's height will be 75% of the screen height
- Prespective point will resize according to the screen size by updating all cordinate point
- We will display vertcal ines on the screen with spacing of 10% of vertical height
- Now we will transform this 2d cordinate to a mosre refined form of 3d cordinate using a transform function
- Transformation is done via computing linear proportion
- Now we will add some horizontal line to the prespective with constant spacing

## Vertical and Horizontal lines
